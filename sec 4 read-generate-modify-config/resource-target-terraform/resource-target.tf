/*

=> Example Terraform Commands:

    terraform apply -target=aws_iam_user.my_user

  -> This will only create my_user, not the security group or file.

    terraform plan -target=local_file.my_text_file

  ->  Shows the plan for just the local_file resource.

=>  Note:

  -> Resource targeting is great for testing, but itâ€™s not recommended for normal day-to-day use in production.

  -> It can break dependency chains if you're not careful.
