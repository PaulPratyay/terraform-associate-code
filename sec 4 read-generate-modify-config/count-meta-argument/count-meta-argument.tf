/*

Notes: 

=> Why no error even though all 3 instances are named "myec2"?

    -> The key is in the count meta-argument. Here's how Terraform handles it:

        -> aws_instance.myec2 is the resource name.

        -> When we use count = 3, Terraform creates 3 separate instances internally like this:

            -> aws_instance.myec2[0]

            -> aws_instance.myec2[1]

            -> aws_instance.myec2[2]

    -> So although we wrote just one block with the name myec2, Terraform indexes each instance behind the scenes â€” just like an array â€” to keep them separate.

    -> No naming conflict happens because Terraform handles them as separate indexed instances.
