=> Load Order Semantics in Terraform refers to the order in which Terraform loads and processes files in a configuration directory.

In Simple Words:

-> Terraform looks at all the .tf and .tf.json files in your folder. The order of the files does not matter, because:

-> Terraform loads all configuration files in a directory simultaneously (not line-by-line or top-to-bottom).

=> So what does "load-order-semantic" mean in Terraform?

It means:

-> We donâ€™t have to worry about file names or order like you would in traditional programming.

-> Terraform parses all files together, merges their definitions, and builds the resource graph from that.

=> Summary:

->  "Load-order semantic" means: Terraform does not rely on file order.
-> All .tf files in a folder are treated as one combined configuration.
-> We can split files logically (e.g., provider.tf, main.tf, outputs.tf) without worrying about which loads first.
