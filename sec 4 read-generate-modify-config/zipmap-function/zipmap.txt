The zipmap() function in Terraform is very useful when you want to create a map from two lists â€” one for keys, and the other for values.


zipmap(keyslist, valueslist)

    -> Takes two lists:
        -> The first list becomes the keys.
        -> The second list becomes the values.
    -> Returns a map

=> Use Case Ideas:

    -> Dynamically assign tags to resources

    -> Combine two separate input lists into one variable

    -> Pass key-value pairs into a module
