=> Basics of Functions

	-> A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
	-> It is a reusable logic block that takes input and gives output.
	-> So, we give a function some data (called arguments or inputs), and it returns a result.
	
	# Function 1 - MAX
	
		-> max() takes one or  ore numbers and returns the greatest number.
		
	# Function 2 - FILE
	
		-> file() reads the contents of a file at the given path and returns them as a string.

	-> Terraform Console provides an ineractive environment specifically designed to test functions and 
	   experiment with expressions before integrating them into our main code.
