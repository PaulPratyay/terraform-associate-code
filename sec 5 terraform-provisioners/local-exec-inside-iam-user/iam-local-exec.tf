/*

=> Whatâ€™s Happening Step by Step:

  -> Terraform will create an IAM user named demo-user.

=> After creation:

  -> The first local-exec provisioner runs:
    -> prints: local-exec provisioner is starting

  -> Then the second provisioner runs:
    -> prints: local-exec provisioner is starting for second time

  -> Both commands run on your local terminal, not on AWS.

=> This is helpful when you want to:

  -> Run multiple scripts or commands after a resource is created.
  -> Chain steps (like logging, file generation, notifications).
  -> Experiment with execution order and local automation.
