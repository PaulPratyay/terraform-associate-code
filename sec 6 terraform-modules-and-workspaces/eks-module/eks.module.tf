/*
=> Whatâ€™s Happening:

  -> We are using a pre-built EKS module instead of writing everything from scratch.

=> We specify:

  -> Subnets where EKS will run.
  -> A cluster name (test).
  -> A specific version of the module (20.37.1) to avoid future breaking changes.

=> This module creates:

  -> EKS Control Plane
  -> IAM Roles
  -> Worker Node Groups (optional if you provide more inputs)
  -> Networking and associated resources (if configured)

=>  What You Should Do Next:

  -> This module requires many other inputs if you want to customize node groups, roles, VPC settings, etc.
  -> Minimum inputs to make it work in real setups:
    -> vpc_id
    -> cluster_version
    -> node_groups block
