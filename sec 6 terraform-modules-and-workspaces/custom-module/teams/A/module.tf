/*
=> in simple terms:

  -> I created a template (module) that knows how to launch EC2.

  -> I then used that template in Team A's folder and passed real values.

=> When I run terraform apply from teams/A, it:

  -> Reads the module from modules/ec2

  -> Uses your inputs (AMI & instance type)

  -> Launches an EC2 instance in us-east-1 using those inputs.

=> Why is this useful?

  -> If Team B also wants an EC2 instance, they just call the same module with different values.

 -> You donâ€™t repeat code. You just reuse and plug in different inputs.
